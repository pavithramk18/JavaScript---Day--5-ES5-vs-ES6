// window Object:

// *The window object is the global object in the browser's JavaScript environment.
// *It represents the browser window or tab in which your web page is displayed.
// *You can access various properties and methods related to the browser window, including managing pop-up windows, 
// interacting with the browser's history, and controlling the browser's location and size.

// Example:window.alert("This is a alert");

// screen Object:

// *The screen object represents the user's screen or monitor.
// *It provides information about the user's screen resolution, color depth, and other screen-related 
// properties.
// *This object is useful for creating responsive designs and determining the available screen space.

// Example:const screenWidth=screen.width;

// document Object:

// *The document object represents the web page itself, including its content 
// and structure (the HTML document).
// *It allows you to manipulate and interact with the DOM (Document Object Model), 
// which is a representation of the web page's structure.
// *You can access and modify elements, attributes, and content within the 
// web page using the document object.

// Example:const demo = document.getElementById("demo");
